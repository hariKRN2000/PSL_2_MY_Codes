## These codes were written by me for the Process Simulation Lab. Some of the interesting ones are the Linear Regression model, Lorenz attractor animation, <br>
## Vapur-Liquid Equilibria Data analysis and the Counter Current Heat Exchanger Animation <br>
## I also have interesting "Tools" written for VLE - Data Analysis, Distillation Column Design and Transient simulation, Cooling Tower etc. <b>
Please feel free to suggest any changes or if you want to view the newer codes
